# [NEW REPOSITORY GO **__HERE__**](https://github.com/JOwen-ster/s3vods)


Could make a YouTube account with all the vods and use the site as a way to search through the youtube channel in a better way (via player or weapon) then clicking on the site redirects to the youtube video with the vod. Since you cant search youtube video via weapon and player unless its in the title, description, or tags to my knowledge.

Add CONTRIBUTING.md

Add page buttons to bottom of screen

Add responsive layout (landing page)

Add more info to landing page (mission, how to add vods, who made it, source code on footer)

Add black border (tag styling) to player name (invert colors on hover) 

Add dark mode
